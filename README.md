### Hypothesis testing of hypothesis testing

```
Dear All,

Attached is the list of the names of the Ames hybrids we have evaluated in the
past (Ames x PHZ51 and/or PHB47). Please share it with the people in your groups
who may be interested in testing annotation hypothesis. I will be happy to 
send data to do the testing (yield, PH) if someone is interested.  
   

I also attached the names of the NAM-PHZ51 hybrids. But the data will not be 
ready until a couple weeks from now.


Best,
```
